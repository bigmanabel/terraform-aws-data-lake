# terraform-aws-data-lake
Serverless data lake on AWS using S3, Glue, and Athena — built with Terraform. This project provisions a fully automated data lake architecture that enables ingestion, cataloging, and querying of structured or semi-structured data using AWS-native services. It leverages Amazon S3 for raw data and query outputs, AWS Glue for schema discovery and metadata cataloging, and Amazon Athena for running SQL queries directly against S3-stored data. Ideal for data engineering pipelines, analytics workloads, and cloud-native ETL — all defined as Infrastructure as Code.
